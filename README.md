First thing that runs is the readData function, there is no output to this function

Next the checkNumber function will run and depending on the input it will affect your output:

In my case I entered 5 and it was found in index 5.

Next the modifyValue function is ran asking the user for an index and the value they wish to replace the current value with:

In my case I changed index 89 with the value of 720.

Next the addValue function is ran and it asks the user for a number:

In my case I added the value of 891, and this is added to the end of the array.

Finally the removeValue function is ran, asking the user which index they would like to remove:

In my case I removed the value that was at index 21.
